        Clicking on different objects that seemed like they were interactable
        
        5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?
        
        Display a 3d artistic rendition of the main projects that luni wants  to highlight. 
        
        6) How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
        Through the use of the mini renditions themselves, they communicate what the goal is of the products that they have created aim to serve
        7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
        Once or twice, as it feels like a mini portfolio
        8) How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?
        There are no such things as dashboards or login screens. It is only the mini renditions themselves, some information on the product they have made, the team and the home page
