            This is a short written response to <a href="https://www.luni.app/" class="button">Luni</a> 

        </p>
            Week 2

    
            <p><h3>1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h3></p>
            The lively 3d scenery. The first thing the site does when it loads in is allow you to see the entire 3d area and as such, allows you to slowly take in everything and look at each environment more clearly. 
        </p>
            <h3>2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h3>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>The first thing I did was click the notebook to see if it would be interactable. After this, I looked around in the 'lounge' area to see if anything else was too. Through this, I could roughly gauge what might me interactable and what not throughout the website viewing experience </li>
            <li>As the sports sectioin was the 'first' in line (furthest left in the lineup), I clicked on this element first and it then brought me to the Omada section. </li>
            <li>Clicked on the soccer ball and interacted with the small soccer section. From there, I clicked around some more to see what everything could do. </li>
            <li>After interacting with everything on the page, I clicked and read through the ‘discover omada’ section.</li>
            <li>From here I returned back home and looked at the next section 'spark'. Similar to the Omada section, I clicked around and interacted with various objects to see the little animations</li>
            <li>Instead of returning back manually, I scrolled down to see the next section 'Kitchen lab'. Similar to every other page, I clicked on the different objects. Unlike the other sections though was on the information page. After clicking on it, and clicking through the daily life button, I scrolled through the different images of the gallery</li>
            

        </ol>
        
        These were the things I did within the first few minutes.
            
            <p>
            <h3>3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3>
            
            I found that looking for interactable objects and details in each scene was the most engaging part of the website experience. 
        </p>
            <h3>4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h3>
            
            Clicking on different objects that seemed like they were interactable.
            <p>
            <h3>5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>
        
            My impression was that the site functions as a mini 3d rendition of the projects that the Luni team has made.  
        </p>
            <h3>6) How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h3>
            Through the use of the mini renditions themselves, they communicate what the goal is of the products that they have created aim to serve.
        </p>
            <h3>7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h3>
            Once or twice, as it feels like a mini portfolio for other people who are interested in Luni to see. You can see everything on the site in roughly 10 minutes and as such, allow it to be a relatively quick viewing experience. 
            <h3>8) How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h3>
            There are no such things as dashboards or login screens. It is only the mini renditions themselves, some information on the product they have made, the team and the home page, all of which are easy to view quickly.

    <p>
        Week 3
    </p>
        <h3>9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h3>
        There are several references within each rendition of each scene. 
        <p>For the Omada section: A racetrack, soccer field and basketball court are all referenced. Sports betting for money also.
        </p>For the Sparks section: Lakes and spa’s are obviously referenced, as well as wellness excercise imagery (such as yoga mats, running shoes etc.)
        <p>For the Kitchenlab one: Lounge room imagery is envoked through its use of lounge furniture.
        </p>For the coaching+ section: Fitness objects are used throughout the entire scene (boxing, dumbells and weights etc.). 
        <p></p>
        Throughout each one, at least one electronic device is referenced and/or invoked (phone, Laptop, sports money betting screen of an app etc. )
       <p>
        <h3>10) What do this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
        <p>The references give clues as to what the purpose of each product that Luni has made in a concise way. Omada is a way of enjoying sports betting without expending real money and as such, a fake usable currency is referenced throughout the entire scene.</p>
    </p>
        
        <h3>11) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
        The general feeling that one should have when using a product from Luni is shown through its references when engaging with the website. Spark uses spa-like imagery throughout the entire section and that allows the users to feel like how they would using that product: calm. This is the same throughout every section.
        <p>
        <h3>12) What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h3>
        Items that look interactable are sometimes not. Its relatively a minor problem as the site is very well made but a lot of time can be spent trying to figure out what items are interactable in the first place. 
    </p>
        <h3>13) What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h3>
        The visuals are, in my opinion, the best part of the site. It captures everything in an incredibly visually appealing way.
